Air quality is an essential factor that needs to be maintained due to its toxic and harmful pollutants causing negative health effects. These toxic pollutants consist of emissions from activities like chemical processing, cement manufacturing, power generation, oil and gas refining etc. Reduction of exhaust gases from these industries is extremely necessary. Air quality control systems provides solutions for gases and pollutants treatment and begins the release of clean air. Increasing demand for power and rapid industrialization has increase the emission of toxic pollutants, and exhaust gases, hence generating a huge demand for these air quality systems.",

Methods: Total RNA was isolated according to the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and treated with DNase I. RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and RNA Nano Chip kit (Agilent Technologies, CA). RNA-seq libraries were generated using TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo-Zero Globin Complete kit (Illumina, CA). Approximately 60–80 million paired-end 150 bp reads were generated per sample using Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform Results: RNA-seq revealed an enriched pro-inflammatory gene signature in SDHB cKO T cells after activation Conclusions: SDH inactivation results in a pro-inflammatory gene signature in T cells after activation",

The differences in effects from organic and inorganic forms of these toxic elements is less well understood, however. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is a suitable model to investigate the toxicity of environmental hazards. In this study, the transcriptomic profiles of C. elegans exposed to inorganic mercury chloride (HgCl2) and sodium (meta)arsenite (NaAsO2) were assessed alongside organic methylmercury chloride (meHgCl) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA). For this purpose, adult C. elegans were exposed for 24 h to NaAsO2 (10 µg/ml), DMA (200 µg/ml), HgCl2 (2 µg/ml), and meHgCl (0.5 µg/ml), concentrations that were equitoxic in juveniles for developmental delay. Whole genome gene expression profiles were determined by using Cellegans_UnrestrictedGE_G2519F_020186 Microarray (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).",

However, non-hormonal factors that control WD homeostasis and development remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the contribution of Hedgehog signaling pathway to Wolffian duct development by combining pharmacological approaches on organotypic cultures of WD with microarray profiling. Methods: WD were collected from embryos isolated from 16.5 days post-coitum pregnant mice and cultured in air-liquid condition at 37oC during 72 hours in the presence of either: 1) Cyclopamine (25 µM): Hh inhibitor; 2) Smoothened agonist (0.5 µM ; SAG): Hh activator; 3) Culture media (control). WD pictures were taken and analyzed on ImageJ. At the end of the culture, WD were snap-frozen to perform transcriptomic microarray analyses.",

Use Agilent miRNA array for miRNA analysis. Each slide of the Agilent array is designed as eight identical arrays (8×60K format), and each array contains probes for detecting 2549 human mature miRNAs from miRBase R21.0. Each miRNA was repeatedly detected by the probe 30 times. The array also contains 2164 Agilent control probes. GeneSpring software V13 (Agilent) was used to analyze the miRNA array data for data aggregation, standardization and quality control. Perform the default 90th percentile normalization method for date preprocessing. To select differentially expressed genes, we used thresholds of ≥2 and ≤−2 fold change, and the Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p vlaue was 0.05.",

As such therapeutics can impair normal functioning of host proteins, a clear understanding of their impact on cellular mechanisms is critically important. Here, we characterized the interactions of a host-targeted anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic, SNX-5422, with the cellular machinery using a physiologically relevant ex vivo human primary tracheobronchial epithelial (TBE) cell model. Methods: Fully differentiated human TBE cells (EpiAirwayTM) from 3 independent donors with no reported respiratory disease or smoking history were obtained from MatTek (Ashland, MA).",
